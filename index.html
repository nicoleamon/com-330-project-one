  <p>
    My name is Nicole and I’ve wanted to be an Engineer since I was in 8th grade. I’ve always been drawn towards science and math and worked hard to excel at it.
    Fast forward five years later and I started my academic career at College of DuPage to work towards an Associate degree in Engineering Science.
    A couple years later, I transferred to Illinois Institute of Technology with the goal to learn and absorb as much as possible.
    After doing my general electives, I was excited to jump right into my core engineering courses.
    I’m a 4th year Mechanical Engineering student nearing the end of my career at IIT and I’m excited to learn a lot in my last semester.

    In this class, I look forward to transforming my knowledge from creating this plain text to a fully formed site.
    By taking this class and pushing myself to do and create something new that I’ve never done before, I am hoping to work hard to create something that I can be proud of.
    In addition to learning how to create a Website, I want to make myself stand out as successful candidate for job opportunities.
    By working on a site for myself, I want to showcase my strengths all at the click of a link. I’d also like to work on creating an aesthetically unique and well-formed site.

    Beyond IIT, I’m planning on using my degree to pursue a career in saving the world. My dream as an Engineer is to make a difference. For a while, I didn’t know what that meant.
    At first, this to me meant that I could develop something entirely new for the world. Then, it shifted towards a focus on the environment.
    I previously worked at Argonne National Laboratory for an internship where I was exposed to research on nuclear power plants and energy systems.
    It has become increasingly important to me that I have a career in renewable energy and sustainability. Recently, I worked for BP using drones and working within their pipelines group doing data integrity.
    I am hoping that through my internship experiences, that I find myself in a career where I have projects involving renewable energy or manufacturing/designing for sustainable products.
    I’d also like to incorporate a thought that started this career. With the combination of my knowledge in engineering and future experience, I will create something new for the world and it will involve efficient energy use that is sustainable for the future.
    I’m not sure what it is yet, but I'm going for it.
